## The COVID Community Vulnerability Index

The Community Vulnerability Index (CVI) is the first public project developed by Community Insight and Impact. 

CVI was started during the New Lab COVID-19 [Data Hack](https://newlab.com/event/covid-19-data-hack/). The tool aims to provide a variety of indices to assess community vulnerability due to the impact of COVID-19, including adverse health outcomes, and disparate socioeconomic harms, across the entire US at the county level. The tool can be used by a variety of stakeholders: by healthcare systems to identify testing and service deserts and effectively allocate existing resources, by community organizations to find outreach areas and understand needs, and by policymakers to inform funding and decision making.

Use the CVI Web App [here](https://dash-cvi-dashboard.herokuapp.com/) and the simple version [here](https://pumagic.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/be9712cf50f843f5a346ea145e82e01c).
