### Current Partnership Projects
* Vaccine Equity study with Mechanism Design for Social Good: We are exploring two of the main benefits of accelerating the vaccine donation timeline by richer countries to the global South. We intend to contribute to the debate around vaccine sharing, providing motivation for vaccine altruism.
* Planned Parenthood sexual education study: CII is currently partnering with Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, supporting the organization in its mission to provide reproductive health care services and education. We are developing a customized vulnerability metric for identifying communities lacking in sexual health care with the goal of helping Planned Parenthood identify where their services are most needed.

### Current Projects
* CVI core metrics and CVI validation studies: We are finalizing our three core metrics: Severe COVID Case Complications, Risk of Severe Economic Harm, and Need for Mobile Health Resources. Additionally, we are applying supervised learning on proxy outcomes and longitudinal studies to deliver actionable insights in improving our core metrics for the next iteration of metrics.
* COVID / Public Health policy study: We seek to characterize the relationship (if any) between outcomes (particularly related to our metrics) and governmental policy interventions in order to make policy recommendations to local governments for effective recovery or for future pandemics.
